# Python-TCV-Root-Cause-Analysis-Toolbox
A program encoded using Python programming language that transform the statistical process control (SPC) using total conditional variance (TCV) algorithm into an executable program, to perform root cause analysis on the input dataset and identify the ranking of the major contributors to the variance in the dataset.

The program won a Silver award in International Research and Symposium and Exposition (RISE) 2020, and a Gold award in International Malaysia-Indonesia-Thailand Symposium on Innovation & Creativity - iMITSIC 2021. The extended abstract of the program is published in a proceeding entitled 'PROSIDING-IMITSIC-2021' on page 52 (URL:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354329818_PROSIDING-IMITSIC-2021).

The code is kept confidential.
